# BanglaHandWrittenDigitsRecognitionCNN
Bangla handwritten digits recognition using Convolutional Neural Network (TensorFlow)

This Keras model provides accuracy around 60%. Datasets are created using Paint. Train dataset contains only 66 data(for category 1,2,3,4).Test dataset contains only 20 entries(1,2,3,4). The accuracy should be improved if the dadaset can be extended.
